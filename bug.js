This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a functional component.  The issue arises when trying to access the current value of the ref inside a function that's not directly part of the component's render cycle. For example, accessing `myRef.current` inside a timeout callback or an event handler might result in `undefined` if the component unmounts before the callback is executed.
