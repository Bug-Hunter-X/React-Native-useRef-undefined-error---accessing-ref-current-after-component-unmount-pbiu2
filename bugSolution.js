The solution involves using a cleanup function within the `useEffect` hook. This function will be called before the component unmounts, allowing you to clean up any references to the ref, thus preventing the error.  Here's how the code should be modified:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Cleanup function to be executed before component unmount
    return () => {
      // Set ref.current to null to ensure it's not referenced any more
      myRef.current = null; 
    };
  }, []);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // Accessing myRef.current here is now safe
      if (myRef.current) {
        console.log(myRef.current);
      }
    }, 1000);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Click me" onPress={handleClick} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
By adding the cleanup function, we ensure that `myRef.current` is set to `null` before the component unmounts. This prevents any further attempts to access the ref after it has become invalid.
